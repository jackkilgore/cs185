		Thesis:
		An Intimate Collection of Casual AV Pairings. Please I want to find something out and be able to think in more
		concrete language. HERE is an exercise in writing the head. Here is an exercise in forming communicable ideas. Here
		is an exercise in being human.

	<!-- Process
	On an individual level, lacks narrative structure
		The aggregate becomes a narrative.
    Notice moments. Analogous to a walk.
    Document moments through audio/visual/language.
        NOTE: No need for awareness to the overarching narrative structure.
        Strive for focus on the immediate details.
    Willingness to communicate these documented moments to others.
    Attempt to connect and build new moments though creation with others.
        eg. M took a video they liked. J made a field-recording they liked. M and J make an audiovisual piece with their respective documentation.
        NOTE: No need for awareness to the overarching narrative structure.
        Strive for focus on the immediate details.
    Release casual collaborations into the internet.
    Repeat steps 1 - 5 till a desire for overarching narrative becomes overwhelming.
    Take previous collaborations and edit/splice them to build a cohesive collage of what has been documented.
        This is where its okay to be critical yet reflective on what has been documented.
            Use this self-reflection as a means to build projects more traditionally organized.
        Essentially, this is the equivalent of a released album/song/art project that someone would post on their website. -->
